## KG PoC for the Case Study: AI Platform engineer

This package provides an ETL data pipeline that ingests EB datasets into a Relational and Graph database.
The following datasets are ingested:
- NAEB (Natural Products Activity and Species Source Database): Focuses on the biological activities of natural products and their species sources.
- NPASS (Natural Product Activity and Species Source Database): Contains data on natural product molecules including their biological activities and source organisms.
- ChEMBL: A large-scale bioactivity database for drug discovery, containing chemical, bioactivity, and genomic data.

## ðŸ”§ Quick Install
- Steps for usage:

1. Clone the repository.

```

2. Download the resources like the NAEB, NPASS datasets
3. Download the Chembl dataset from the [ChEMBL website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/).

4. Install poetry in your system. For more information, visit the [Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
